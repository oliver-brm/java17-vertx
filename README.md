Example code of a modular Java 17 web app using Vert.x.

This code was forked from [Paul Bakker's repo](https://github.com/java9-modularity/java9-vertx), which was written
together with the blog post [Java 9 modules with Vertx](http://paulbakker.io/java/java9-vertx/).

The project can be built and run using Gradle.
